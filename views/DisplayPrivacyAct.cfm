Session cookies are normally deleted from a user's computer when the user logs off the computer or the user exits the browser. As of January, 2001, the Department does not issue &quot;persistent cookies&quot; � types of cookies that could be stored permanently on your workstation and reused each time you visit the Department's Web site.
